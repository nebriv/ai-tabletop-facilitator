/**
 * Coverage for the plan-panel side-rail refactor (this PR). The user's
 * complaint was that the AI-proposed plan rendered *below* the chat
 * reply form, so the Approve button sat in the form's button row
 * instead of next to the artifact it commits. The fix: 2-column
 * layout at xl+, plan in an aside on the right with its own Approve
 * button at the bottom.
 *
 * These tests guard the two structural branches (no-plan, with-plan)
 * and the load-bearing copy / aria-label / placeholder details. They
 * don't exercise sticky-positioning behavior (jsdom has no layout)
 * — that piece is covered by manual smoke at xl viewports per the
 * CLAUDE.md "for UI changes, drive the dev server in a browser" rule.

/**
 * The plan-drafting wait is 10–30 s of LLM work; pre-fix, the operator
 * only saw the small typing dots inside the chat transcript and the
 * LOOKS READY button reading as "stuck." A prominent in-chat banner
 * with the brand DieLoader names the wait as an explicit step.
 *
 * From SetupView's perspective the banner is gated on a single boolean
 * (``draftingPlan``). The Facilitator merges TWO origins into that
 * prop with ``draftingPlan || aiDraftingPlan``:
 *
 *  - Operator-initiated path — ``handleLooksReady`` flips local
 *    ``draftingPlan`` state when the operator clicks LOOKS READY →
 *    PROPOSE THE PLAN.
 *  - AI-initiated path — the backend streams the setup-tier LLM call
 *    and broadcasts ``setup_drafting_plan active=true`` the moment the
 *    model commits to ``propose_scenario_plan`` (covering the case
 *    where the AI decides on its own that it has enough background).
 *    The Facilitator mirrors that into ``aiDraftingPlan``.
 *
 * Regular setup back-and-forth keeps only the small "AI is typing"
 * dots inside <SetupChat> — neither origin fires for
 * ``ask_setup_question``.
 *
 * The banner intentionally relies on ``<DieLoader>``'s own
 * ``role="status" aria-live="polite"`` rather than wrapping in a
 * second status region (nested live regions are flaky across screen
 * readers). The label inside DieLoader carries the timing
 * expectation so a single announcement covers both pieces.
