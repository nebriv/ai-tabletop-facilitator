 * Dev-only scenario picker shown on Step 01 of the setup wizard

 * whole wizard manually.
 *
 * Click → calls ``/api/dev/scenarios/{id}/play`` (no token needed
 * when ``DEV_TOOLS_ENABLED=true``); the backend returns IMMEDIATELY
 * with a session id + creator token, then runs the play / end /
 * AAR phases in a background task. We navigate the same tab to
 * ``/play/:sessionId/:token`` (the App router's two-segment route;
 * the one-segment shape silently falls through to the home page)
 * so the dev watches the replay unfold live via the existing WS
 * broadcasts — same code path, no new routes to maintain.
 *
 * Hidden when the backend gate is closed (``disabled=true``).
