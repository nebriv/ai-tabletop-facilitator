/**
 * Side-panel rendering of the proposed plan with an APPROVE button at
 * the bottom of the panel — the action lives ON the artifact it
 * commits, not buried in the reply-form button row beneath the chat.
 *
 * Sizing strategy:
 *   - Below xl: this section renders at its intrinsic height; the
 *     wizard's ``overflow-auto`` ``<section>`` (see SetupWizard.tsx)
 *     handles outer page scroll. No internal scroll, no max-h.
 *   - At xl+: ``xl:max-h-[calc(100vh-11rem)]`` caps the panel below
 *     the wizard chrome (Eyebrow + h1 "AI is drafting the plan" +
 *     helper paragraph + ``lg:p-8`` outer padding ≈ 160px / 10rem).
 *     The extra ~16px buffer keeps the Approve footer comfortably
 *     above the fold on first render even before the operator
 *     scrolls the chrome out of view. After scrolling, the sticky
 *     aside (``xl:top-2``) keeps the panel pinned with whitespace
 *     below — visible-Approve > tightly-fitting-panel.
 *     ``xl:overflow-hidden`` contains the children; ``xl:flex-1
 *     xl:min-h-0 xl:overflow-auto`` on the body lets PlanView scroll
 *     internally while the header + Approve footer stay pinned.
 *     ``xl:min-h-0`` is load-bearing — without it the flex-child
 *     body refuses to shrink below its content size and the scroll
 *     never engages.
 *
 * Header includes the plan title so the operator keeps that context
 * even after scrolling the body — the original ``<details>`` summary
 * showed it for the same reason.
